# MVP requirements traceability

This matrix audits every normative requirement against production code, automated
tests, and accepted external evidence. It is a release-control document, not a claim
that the unchecked MVP gates are complete.

Status meanings:

- **verified** — implemented and covered by automated tests or accepted external evidence;
- **implemented** — implemented, but an explicitly listed external validation remains;
- **deferred** — intentionally moved beyond MVP by an accepted ADR;
- **gap** — the current implementation does not yet satisfy the literal requirement;
- **planned** — accepted target for the next MVP increment and intentionally not yet implemented.

## Functional requirements

| --- | --- | --- |
| FR-A01, FR-A02, FR-A03 | verified | `discovery.py`; discovery and recursive CLI tests. |
| FR-A04 | verified | `media/probe.py`; media-probe tests and ADR-0015 format matrix. |
| FR-A05 | deferred | Direct files are content-probed regardless of suffix. Content-aware inclusion of arbitrary-extension directory entries is deferred by ADR-0017; configured standard audio formats remain supported and externally validated. |

| FR-A08, FR-A08.1, FR-A08.2, FR-A08.3 | verified | Symlink rejection/skip tests across discovery, grouping, and CLI behavior. |
| FR-B00, FR-B01, FR-B02, FR-B03 | verified | `group_discovered_files`; grouping tests cover suffix and speaker-count semantics. |
| FR-B04 | verified | Explicit `--group` contract, tests, and ADR-0012 external validation. |

| FR-B08 | verified | Application-level dry-run/transcription ambiguity guard, coded error, same-stem regression test, and real WSL MP3/WAV discovery evidence. |
| FR-C00, FR-C01, FR-C02, FR-C03, FR-C04 | verified | Channel analysis/classification tests and Phase 2/7/10 external matrices. Enum values use hyphens at the CLI boundary and correspond to the underscore names in this requirement. |
| FR-C05, FR-C06, FR-C07 | verified | Configuration, stream-planning, and pipeline tests; Phase 7/8 evidence. |
| FR-C08 | verified | `inspection.py` applies explicit, filename, selected-stream title, then default priority; focused provenance/signature tests. |
| FR-C09 | verified | Chronological reconciliation tests and ADR-0013 release evidence. |
| FR-D00, FR-D01, FR-D02 | verified | Language configuration/CLI tests and ADR-0011. English execution is supported; corpus accuracy remains deferred by ADR-0014. |

## Open release work resulting from this audit

1. Keep dataset-dependent English, three-speaker, timestamp, and DER/JER accuracy gates deferred under
   ADR-0014 until annotated archive-derived references exist.


## v0.2.0 implemented transcript-revision requirements

Their normative definitions are in `02-requirements.md` and `13-transcript-revisions.md`.

| Requirement | Status | Planned implementation/evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FR-J00, FR-J03, FR-J15, FR-J18 | verified | Revision domain/storage, ADR-0020, immutable full snapshots, and atomic allocator tests. |
| FR-J01, FR-J02 | verified | `EWP-REVIEW 1`, prepare/apply services, deterministic discovery, failure-isolated batch tests, and the accepted private-corpus workflow. |
| FR-J04, FR-J05, FR-J06, FR-J07, FR-J11, FR-J12 | verified | Anchored alignment tests cover supported edits, repetition preservation, anchor integrity, and ambiguity warnings. |
| FR-J08 | verified | `EffectiveTranscript` inherits canonical timing without canonical timestamp mutation. |
| FR-J09, FR-J10 | verified | Preview equivalence and external-editor lifecycle tests; staged VS Code editing is the preferred operator path. |
| FR-J13, FR-J14 | verified | Revision provenance/statistics and reconstructable or published detailed audit. |
| FR-J16, FR-J17 | verified | Revision resolution and TXT/SRT/VTT/segments export use one `EffectiveTranscript` without audio or models. |
| NFR-013, NFR-014 | verified | Determinism fixtures and shared CLI/correction/translation application boundaries; the future GUI must reuse them. |

## v0.3 automated-correction requirements

| Requirement | Status | Planned implementation/evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FR-K00, FR-K01, FR-K03, FR-K07 | verified | Provider-neutral mock, LM Studio, and OpenRouter paths correct canonical or explicitly selected compatible revision text through the existing aligner and immutable revision storage. Child revisions retain exact parent lineage and remain complete standalone snapshots. |
| FR-K02, FR-K04 | verified | Strict speaker-block text response validation, locally derived exact per-block change lists, and the hashed LM Studio faithful-repair prompt prohibit paraphrase, style/grammar repair, summary, translation, and meaningful deletion. |
| FR-K05, FR-K06, NFR-015 | verified | Deterministic gap-free editable chunks, bounded read-only overlap, operation hashes, configuration validation, and boundary tests. |
| FR-K08, FR-K09, FR-K10, FR-K11, FR-K12, NFR-016 | verified | Local/cloud consent policy, strict-offline rejection, exact-scope private persistence, CLI warning/choice behavior, zero-call rejection, and sanitized failures are tested. |
| FR-K13 | verified | LLM revisions record provider/model/endpoint kind and prompt ID/content hash; operation and resume identity include the actual prompt/schema hash. |
| FR-K14, FR-K15 | verified | Adapter timeout budgets, bounded explicit retries, validated resume entries, deterministic batches, failure isolation, and stop policy tests. |
| FR-K16 | verified | The in-process deterministic provider exercises request, validation, alignment, and revision publication without network or models. |
| FR-K17, FR-K18 | verified | Exact-lineage canonical/revision cases report lexical outcomes, exact normalized gold-relative edit precision/recall, revision activity, warnings, alignment warnings, and speaker preservation. Private resume evidence now aggregates attempts, retries, provider latency, requests, tokens, cost, and legacy-entry coverage; unsupported/style interpretation remains an explicit manual review task. |
| FR-K19 | verified | CLI and operator documentation label automated output as a non-final candidate and require manual wording/speaker/punctuation/quotation review before final or gold use. |

## v0.4 translation and platform-export acceptance

The v0.4 contracts are defined in `23-v0.4-translation-contract.md`,
`24-v0.4-timed-event-semantics.md`, and the corresponding roadmap gates.

| Capability | Status | Implementation and evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Manual and automated translation | verified | Exact source lineage, speaker-safe sentence units, immutable manual/non-final artifacts, prepare/preview/apply/audit/export, retry/resume providers, and accepted Bielik end-to-end pilot. |
| Semantic translation benchmark | verified | Exact-lineage private human assessments and content-free direction-specific reports; semantic fidelity is separate from dictionary convention adherence. |
| Project dictionaries | verified | Explicit versioned/hashed translation and correction dictionaries, retained approval/rejection decisions, source-aware provider context, audit provenance, Gemini comparison, and accepted held-out `s0e00` result. |
| Timed-event semantics | verified | Canonical/derived schema `1.1`, legacy speech default, revision/effective inheritance, closed kind vocabulary, and YTT/HTML consumption. |
| YouTube srv3 YTT | verified | Deterministic parser-tested exporter and successful unlisted real Polish upload covering wrapping, colors, centering, timing, labels, and diacritics. |
| Embeddable HTML | verified | Escaped sentence-level raw/revised/translated fragments plus separate player; real-media Firefox, LibreWolf, Chrome, and Brave qualification covers range seeking, keyboard/mouse interaction, highlighting/following, theme controls, and no-script fallback. |
| Privacy and reproducibility | verified | `/tmp`-only pilots, no committed private payloads or secrets, content-free benchmark evidence, deterministic exports, immutable source artifacts, the 620-test locked gate, archive-content inspection, and isolated installed-wheel CLI/HTML/YTT smoke checks. |

## Local browser GUI requirements

ADR-0021 and `26-local-web-gui-contract.md` define the common WSL2, bare-metal Ubuntu, and
future-Docker interface. These requirements are intentionally planned, not implied complete
by the existing exported HTML transcript player.

| Requirement | Status | Planned implementation/evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FR-L00, FR-L01, FR-L02, FR-L13, FR-L16 | implemented | `transcriber gui`, bundled offline assets, loopback-only adapter, `/api/v1` health/about/root endpoints, and frontend compatibility rejection. Application-workflow calls begin in the next slice. |
| FR-L03, FR-L17, NFR-020 | partial | Existing directories are normalized into explicit roots; Host validation, restrictive CSP, safe fixed routing, and negative tests are implemented. Root-contained browsing, origin/state-change controls, and download identity arrive with the first state-changing API. |
| FR-L04, FR-L05 | partial | Browser inspect/dry-run calls existing services and retains a bounded structured in-process history. The deterministic single-GPU queue and recoverable persistent operation state remain planned. |
| FR-L06, FR-L07, FR-L08, FR-L09 | planned | Anchor-preserving transcript and translation editors using existing preview/apply/audit/export services and exact lineage. |
| FR-L10 | planned | Project dictionary selection/provenance first; proposal/review management in a later GUI slice. |
| FR-L11, FR-L12 | partial | Startup, Host, and route failures have documented stable codes. Session-only credential/consent handling arrives with provider workflows. |
| FR-L14, FR-L15, NFR-018 | partial | Version, license/warranty, source, and issue information is implemented in the responsive keyboard-native shell. Synchronized media review and explicit theme/follow controls remain planned. |
| NFR-017, NFR-019 | planned | Shared contract tests across WSL2-compatible/native launch modes, then the identical packaged application in Docker; offline acceptance after model setup. |
