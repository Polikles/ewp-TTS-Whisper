# Testing and Acceptance Criteria

Tests are divided into two matrices: application behavior and audio-material types.

Checked application items may be satisfied by deterministic automated tests, recorded WSL
integration gates, or both. Hardware-, player-, and corpus-dependent items remain open until
their corresponding external evidence is accepted.

## 1. Application tests

### Discovery and paths

- [x] Single Windows path with backslashes.
- [x] Windows path with forward slashes.

## 3. Text-quality evaluation

### Ground truth

Every representative sample must have a manually verified reference transcript.

Procedure:

1. Select 5–15 minutes from each material type.
2. Produce a manually verified reference transcript.
3. Define one normalization policy for numbers, capitalization, punctuation, and fillers.
4. Run the local pipeline.
5. Optionally run a recognized online model.
6. Compare both systems independently against the same ground truth.
7. Calculate WER and CER.
8. Manually assess proper names, numbers, technical terminology, and English insertions.

### Regression criterion

After the first baseline is approved, no dependency or parameter change may worsen mean WER by more than one percentage point without an explicit project decision.

## 4. Timestamp evaluation

On a manually aligned subset, measure:

- word-start MAE;
- word-end MAE;
- P50, P90, and P95 error;
- percentage of words without alignment;
- number of cues that cut through words incorrectly.

Initial absolute thresholds are set after the reference corpus exists. The release gate requires no regression against the approved baseline.

## 5. Diarization evaluation

Measure separately:

- DER/JER for mixed mono;
- source-based speaker assignment for separate files/channels, expected to be 100%;
- correctness of normalized `SpeakerN` numbering;
- overlap errors.

## 6. Subtitle review

Perform a manual review in the target player or a private YouTube upload:

- readability;
- no excessively long lines;
- speaker labels;
- timing;
- fast speech;
- speaker transitions;
- Polish characters.


## 7. Transcript revision acceptance (implemented for v0.2.0)

### Review and alignment

- [x] `EWP-REVIEW 1` round-trip with no text edits.
- [x] Punctuation-only edit.
- [x] Proper-name/spelling substitution.
- [x] Sentence-boundary change through punctuation only.
- [x] One-to-one substitution.
- [x] N-to-1 merge.
- [x] 1-to-N split.
- [x] Insertion with adjacent canonical anchors.
- [x] Deletion.
- [x] Legitimate repeated words remain duplicated when not edited.
- [x] Short span reassigned to another existing speaker.
- [x] Ambiguous alignment is reported rather than silently selected.

### Review integrity

- [x] Modified anchor is rejected.
- [x] Missing anchor is rejected.
- [x] Duplicate/overlapping/out-of-order anchors are rejected.
- [x] Nonexistent canonical word ID is rejected.
- [x] Base-result SHA mismatch is rejected.
- [x] Unknown speaker ID is rejected.
- [x] Insert across configured long gap emits a structured warning.

### CLI and batch

- [x] Single-file `revise prepare`.
- [x] Directory `revise prepare` in deterministic natural order.
- [x] Single-file `revise apply`.
- [x] Directory `revise apply` with per-item failure isolation.
- [x] `revise preview` writes no revision.
- [x] `revise apply --no-apply` writes no revision and matches preview outcome.
- [x] `revise edit --no-apply` retains review edits without creating a revision.
- [x] Successful editor close without `--no-apply` automatically applies the saved review.
- [x] Non-zero editor exit creates no revision.

### Persistence and provenance

- [x] Base `results.json` bytes remain unchanged.
- [x] Every revision is a full standalone snapshot.
- [x] Sibling revisions can reference the same base result.
- [x] Parent revision metadata does not make child export depend on parent replay.
- [x] Provenance, alignment metadata, statistics, and warnings are always present.
- [x] `--audit` produces detailed diagnostics without becoming reconstruction state.
- [x] Base-relative detailed audit can be regenerated later from base + revision.
- [x] Concurrent revision allocation cannot collide.

### Revision-aware exports

- [x] Omitted `--revision` is behaviorally equivalent to raw v0.1 export.
- [x] `--revision none` selects raw canonical text.
- [x] `--revision latest` selects only a revision matching the exact base-result hash.
- [x] Explicit revision path is validated against the selected base result.
- [x] Revised TXT uses corrected punctuation and one-sentence-per-line output.
- [x] Revised SRT and VTT use corrected text with inherited canonical timing.
- [x] Revised segments JSON is generated from the same effective transcript.
- [x] Revision prepare/apply/export do not require source audio, GPU, ASR, alignment, or
  diarization models.

Automated evidence is concentrated in `test_review_format.py`,
`test_revision_service.py`, `test_revision_models.py`, `test_revision_storage.py`,
`test_revision_application.py`, the revision CLI/batch tests, and the revision-aware
export tests. Concurrency is exercised with two separate processes contending for the
same output lock and allocating distinct immutable revision numbers.

Operator evidence covers the complete private 24-episode workflow: deterministic batch
prepare/apply, isolated repair of one malformed review, two revision generations with
audits, and successful model-free batch regeneration of TXT/SRT/VTT/segments. The private
corpus itself is not repository test data and is not required by the automated gate.
