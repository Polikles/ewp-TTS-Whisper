# Install stable base tools

These steps install only the non-ML foundation. Application and ML dependencies are
installed later from the committed lockfile.

## 1. Update Ubuntu packages

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

Review the proposed changes before confirming. Restart WSL if the kernel or core WSL packages require it.

## 2. Install base packages

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential ca-certificates curl ffmpeg git ripgrep
```

Verify:

```bash
git --version
rg --version
ffmpeg -version
ffprobe -version
curl --version
```

## 3. Install `uv`

Download the official installer. Reviewing its contents is optional unless required by
your organization's security policy; users are not expected to independently audit the
installer:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh -o /tmp/ewp-uv-install.sh
```

Then install:

```bash
sh /tmp/ewp-uv-install.sh
```

Start a new shell or follow the PATH instruction printed by the installer, then run `uv --version`.

## 4. Prepare Python 3.12

Do not create project metadata yet. Install and verify the required interpreter through `uv`:

```bash
uv python install 3.12
uv run --python 3.12 python --version
```

The second command must report Python 3.12.x. The exact patch version is recorded when the lockfile is created.

## 5. Prepare Linux-filesystem directories

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/projects"
mkdir -p "$HOME/.cache/ewp-transcripts"
mkdir -p "$HOME/.cache/huggingface"
```

Clone the project under `$HOME/projects`, not under `/mnt/c` or another Windows-mounted path.
